synopsis: Library for safe (pattern match free) functions
description: Partial functions from the base library, such as @head@ and @!!@, modified
             to return more descriptive error messages, programmer defined error messages,
             @Maybe@ wrapped results and default values.
             These functions can be used to reduce the number of unsafe pattern matches in
             your code.
