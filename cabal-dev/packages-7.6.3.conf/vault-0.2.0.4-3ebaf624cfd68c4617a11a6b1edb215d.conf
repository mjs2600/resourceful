synopsis: a persistent store for values of arbitrary types
description: A /vault/ is a persistent store for values of arbitrary types.
             It's like having first-class access to the storage space behind IORefs.
             .
             The data structure is analogous to a bank vault,
             where you can access different bank boxes with different keys;
             hence the name.
             .
             Also provided is a /locker/ type, representing a store for a single element.
