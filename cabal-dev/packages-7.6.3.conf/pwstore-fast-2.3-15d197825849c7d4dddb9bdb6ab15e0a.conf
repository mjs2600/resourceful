synopsis: Secure password storage.
description: To store passwords securely, they should be salted,
             then hashed with a slow hash function. This library
             uses PBKDF1-SHA256, and handles all the details.
             It uses the cryptohash package for speed; if you need
             a pure Haskell library, pwstore-purehaskell has the
             exact same API, but uses only pure Haskell. It is
             about 25 times slower than this package, but still
             quite usable.
